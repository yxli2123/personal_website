# Eggbot

## 1. Overview
<center><video width="760" height="570" controls>   <source src="/~anyfine2123/assets/file/eggbot/eggbot_video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></center>

Our eggbot has 2 servos to control the position of eggs and the angle of the pen, a stepper motor to control the height of the pen and a microcontroller unit to manage all these motors.

To draw images on eggs, we also develop an App on iPad to allow users either draw or upload images.

The whole structure is shown in the following image.
